# Introduction to MkDocs

This documentation is built with the Material template for MkDocs. The documentation is stored in the main `BRIDGES_for_CA` folder, where the `mkdocs.yml` contains all layout configurations of the webpage (e.g., order of pages, color scheme, etc.) while the folder `BRIDGES_for_CA/docs/` holds the contents of the documentation (e.g., the texts, a folder for images). The documentation can later be published through GitHub Pages. For now let's edit and view it locally. For that, follow the following steps:

* In a terminal (of your local computer, not sherlock), actiavte your BRIDGES virtual/conda environment (if you use one) and navigate to the `BRIDGES_for_CA` root folder.
* Install `mkdocs-material` using `pip install mkdocs-material`. (To check if you have installed the python package manager `pip` run `pip --version`.)
* Run `mkdocs serve` in the terminal to build the documentation locally. In the terminal you will be provided with a localhost link.
* Click the localhost link or copy it into a browser to view the documentation.
* Make changes to the `mkdocs.yml` file or the `docs/*.md` files. Upon saving, the locally hosted website will update auotmatically.

For building this website, I closely followed [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-YA_dA8C20&t=116s). The detailed documentation of MkDocs can be found [here](https://www.mkdocs.org), the detailed documentation of the Material template can be found [here](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).
